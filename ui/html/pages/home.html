<h1>Welcome to SnippetBin!</h1>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>
        Snippets are encrypted at rest using the AES-256-GCM algorithm with a randomly generated 32-byte key.
    </li>
    <li>
        This encryption key is generated per snippet and is <strong>never stored</strong> on our servers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Only you — or anyone with the full link — can decrypt and view the snippet. If the key is lost, the data is
        <strong>permanently unrecoverable</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        The key is included in the URL as a query parameter (`?key=...`). You must keep this link safe — it is the only
        way to access the snippet contents.
    </li>
    <li>
        Only minimal metadata is stored in plaintext: the snippet title, creation date, and expiry date.
    </li>
    <li>
        User account creation is required to prevent abuse, but snippets are not linked to user accounts in the
        database.
    </li>
    <li>
        Access logging is disabled to ensure privacy. If enabled, logs would include full URLs (and thus keys), making
        snippets potentially visible to system administrators.
    </li>
    <li>
        IP-based rate limiting is enforced to prevent abuse of the platform.
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> While existing encrypted data is safe from server access, anyone with control over
    the web server could:</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>
        View decrypted snippet contents, since decryption happens server-side before sending over HTTPS.
    </li>
    <li>
        Modify server logic to capture and log submitted encryption keys.
    </li>
    <li>
        Enable request logging, which would expose keys in the query parameters.
    </li>
</ul>
